 3 - Read and display the file
Create a setOnItemSelectedListener for your Spinner. Override the required methods for this listener. In this listener, we'll read our file

We're going to use a BufferedReader object for this task since we'll be reading in very large strings

Create a new BufferedReader object and assign it null

Create and initialize a StringBuilder object

Create a try block

You'll need to go through a few steps to add items to the spinner programmatically

Use getAssets().list("") to get a String array containing the names of the items in the assets folder

This will also give you sub directories for that folder, you will need to step through the array and keep all elements with ".txt" in the file names

Create an ArrayAdapter<String> object using the constructor new ArrayAdapter<>(context, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, itemArray)

the first parameter is your activity's context
the layout for the spinner item
the array of items (in this case Strings) to be used in the array
